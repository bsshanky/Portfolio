      "\"I had the opportunity to see Shashank work and evolve as a fresh engineering graduate. In all the roles he took on, he made significant contributions. \n As an application developer, iOS mobile division, he made valuable contributions. Also, as a part of our NavLabs Internship program, he played an instrumental role in the process of up-skilling undergraduate senior students from our partnered colleges in areas of software development and machine learning. What sets him apart is his patience to understand the problem and his perseverance to identify an acceptable solution irrespective of the complexity of the procedure; something rare in today‚Äôs times. He is a quick learner and works very hard to ensure timely delivery; he is values driven. His commitment to work and ability to think critically stands out. \nHe is an employers‚Äô delight and would be an asset wherever he works.\"",
